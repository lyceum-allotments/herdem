BUGS & OTHER ISSUES
===================

* animations are currently broken FIXED (19/02/13)
* the sheep should not 'go crazy' when cornered against a wall
* if you are 'pushing' a sheep with your dog and bang that sheep into another sheep then the second sheep will just obey the normal laws of momentum and go whizzing off a fast speed
* if dog is standing still and get banged into it will start moving, should stand its ground
* dog can appear outside of screen and can leave the screen through the pen
