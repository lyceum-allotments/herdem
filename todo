Herd 'Em Wish List

* Clean the code
    N Haven't looked into this much, but it must be a mess
* Game timer
    - Games should have a time limit, this provides another way to make the game more challenging
    - Have a hall of fame with players who have completed the level in the least time
* Sort out the collision manager
    J You can still tunnel the sheep through walls
* Tile collision handler
    J It would be nice to be able to define a handler to be called when a sprite goes over a certain tile sprite
    J This would allow you to have tiles representing different terrains, avoiding sticky mud or delicious distracting flowers for example might be crucial to finishing the level on time
* More types of levels
    - Separate sheep
        - Have two types of sheep and get them into two types of pen
    - More hazards
        - Fox: Kills sheep but will run away from a sheep-dog
        - Wolf: Kills sheep makes sheep-dog run (a short distance) away from it
        - Big bad wolf: Kills sheep and sheep-dogs?
        - Tractor: ploughing field, crushes sheep and sheep-dogs under its wheels
        - Water: a type of tile that if sheep fall in they drown
            - Maybe they only drown after a certain amount of time but it's possible for a dog to jump in and save them
            - A level could involve getting the sheep to swim cross a river
        - A bridge that if too many sheep get on a section collapses
        - Bones
            - If you get too close to them your dog runs to the bone and stops there until a certain amount of time has passed and it has eaten the bone
    - Don't panic the sheep
        - Have a 'panic-meter' that rises if you get too close to the sheep
    - Get rid of the pen
        - Just have a piece of ground that you have to keep the sheep all on for a certain amount of time
    - Different things to herd
        - Herding cats, much more difficult than herding sheep
* Make dog control more organic
    - Include acceleration
    - Make a dog have a turning circle
* Dogs with different attributes
    - Top speed
    - Acceleration
    - Turning circle
    - Fear factor (how close to a sheep it must get before the sheep runs)
    - Weight
        - The lighter a dog the more quickly it can run over mud/snow etc.
    - Obedience
        - How easily distracted a dog becomes by bones
* Network play
    - Vs. mode where you compete with your friend to see who can get the most sheep into their pen
* Artwork
    - Tiles
        - Stone-walls
        - Grass
        - Mud
        - Flowers
        - Water
    - Idle animations
        - Dog scratching itself when still too long etc.
    - Dead sheep have a grave stone?
    - Tractor
    - Menu screens, splash screen for each level
